# Compiler-Design-Java
In this personal university project, I developed  a simple translator. The primary focus is to implement a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) in Java to facilitate lexical and syntactic analysis.

Objectives:
•	Developed a foundational understanding of DFA and its application in language translation.
•	Implemented lexical analysis for token recognition.
•	Implemented syntactic analysis to structure the translation process.
•	Implemented a simple compiler that translates the JAVA bytecode in human readable source code.
